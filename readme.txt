Video Player for Touchpad

This project combines a file browser activity and video service for the webOS Touchpad.  

Activity:
The file browser is nothing special, just a file browser with a couple parameter switches for ffplay.  

Service:
The service provides an interface to the FFmpeg ffplay binary and also allows generic parameter passing.  

*NOTE* The service requires that the ffplay binary is present in its path.  To build ffplay you can use the forked version of FFmpeg for the Touchpad  here:
