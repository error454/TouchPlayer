Version 1.0.6a<br>
Modified post-install script to attempt to fix install issues.  I was able to reproduce the issue on my device.  I verified that after fixing the files, a simple Luna restart did not resolve the issue but a reboot did.  Therefore, a reboot is now required after install.

Version 1.0.6<br>
One cold night in November, I decided to update TouchPlayer to 1.0.6.  Of the many improvements, the install process should be much smoother.  For those that haven't a clue how to install things, at least you will now get verbose output as to what is wrong with your install.<br>

MKV support hasn't really changed, with audio enabled the CPU is still pegged.  I probably won't be researching enhancements to this for awhile.
